# text-insert-abtest
Chrome extension that will insert text into a text box where the cursor is on a web page, and will allow an A/B testing.

ONE DAY CHALLENGE!! It is 11:21 am Eastern Daylight Time. I will try leveraging GPT 4o and GitHub Copilot to create the following by the end of the day today. I need a Chrome plug-in that allows me to store text templates that insert text into a text box on a web page. When clicked, it will create a pop-up and allow me to select a single template to place into the text box, OR it will allow me to toggle an A/B test that will take two selections and run an A/B test until the toggle is turned off. Bookmark this and follow me to see if I make it, ![ðŸ¥³](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f973.svg "Partying face")or it blows ![ðŸ’£](https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/1f4a3.svg "Bomb")up on me!!

#### Step 1 - create a GitHub repo and clone it locally.
Major interruption 1.
Also added .gitignore for Webstorm and Java Start: 11:24am EDT.
End: 11:41pm EDT

#### Step 2 - Create a WebStorm Project and configure WebStorm.

In addition to creating the WS project, did a little initial visualization of the pop-up, and started crafting initial GPT 4o prompt.

I am using NextChat with GPT 4o API for logging the chat session since it supports markdown and handles code nicely.

Start: 11:41 pm EDT
Stop: 12:00 pm EDT

#### Step 3 - Create and execute initial prompt

[[Initial GPT 4o project prompt]]

Start: 12:00 pm EDT
Stop:  12: 34 pm EDT

#### Step 4 - Add generated code to WebStorm and take care of any problems.

There were a couple of problems - but they were all warnings. Mostly to do with the fact that the project is for a Chrome extension so WebStorm needed context for the chrome object. This can be added as shown by this Stack Overflow "Update 2 Answer" in the following answer to the question:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13997468/how-do-i-use-webstorm-for-chrome-extension-development

After taking care of that, and clearing some warnings that could have been ignored. I am ready to do an initial test of the project.

Breaking now for a bite to eat.

Start: 12:34 pm EDT
Stop: 1:20 pm EDT

#### Step 5 - Initial Extension Test.

SUCCESS!!

The pop-up seemed to work. Along with the add template pop-up.

And then it properly injected the template text into the text box for non A/B test.

It also properly handled the alternating injection from the A/B testing.
